This is a bad red ball clone in p5js, using p5play.

Press q to skip to the next level.
Press w for game journalist mode (only on level 1).
level 4 is the last level.

Purple is the finish line.
Red are barriers.
Everything else is ground.

Made for a school project with 600 lines of unreadable code without comments.

There's also a level editor by pressing p
It's not meant to be used by yall, but heres how to do it anyways.

1. Open your browser's dev tools and open the console
2. Press p while in game
3. In the console, type GP1/GP2 = false (GP1 for ground 1, and GP2 for ground 2, that's it for now.)
4. Click two points you would like the thing to go through.
5. Then click again to print the code that makes a line to console.
6. Run both printed lines to preview.

This is complicated because you're not supposed to use it.
